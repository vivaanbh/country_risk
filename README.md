# country_risk
Using unsupervised learning method, k-means clustering, to classify the risk profile of countries in terms of foreign investment. 

Contents:
- Data
- Exploratory Analysis - descriptive stats, distributions.
- K-means clustering - feature selection & normalization; perform elbow method to choose a number of clusters; different visualisations of clustering.
- Changing the value of n_init - see if the results change with an increase in the number of iterations the algorithm runs. 
- Include a new feature, Corruption Index, to see if k-means clustering results change.
- Perform Agglomerative Heirachal Clustering, and test different linkage criteria.
- Include Venezuela, an outlier in the data to understand changes in results the algorithm produces.

The project is done with the dual aim of, first, using unsupervised machine learning methods to make economic predictions, and second, understanding the changes the algorithm undergoes when its features/data are changed. Please give the report a read for the results!
